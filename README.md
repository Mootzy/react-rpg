# This is the starting point for all DevmentorLive Screencasts

It is really a simple skeleton, started with create-react-app, and then I added the AirbnbCereal font, some basic styles, and the pure-css cdn link. Th point is to have some basic responsive styles without getting too much in the weeds.

## To use it is very simple

```
git clone https://github.com/devmentorlive/starter-cra.git
mv starter-cra WHATEVER_DIR_YOU_WANT_IT_NAMED
cd WHATEVER_DIR_YOU_WANT_IT_NAMED
yarn && yarn start
```

That is it, a browser will open with the project running with webpack dev server, which is included in create-react-app. Open the directory in your favorite code editor (I highly recommend Visual Studio Code) and get to work!

If you will be using git to track your changes, make sure to change your remote:

```
git remote remove origin
git remote add YOUR_REMOTE_HERE
```
