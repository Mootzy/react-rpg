# [RPG GAME] Animate and Move a Character Sprite (Custom React Hooks)

In this screencast we will be using a couple of sprite sets to display a player character on the screen, and then we will build some custom React hooks to animate that character around a simple grassland. All of this lays the groundwork for expanding this series later.

This projects uses sprites from these awesome creators:
